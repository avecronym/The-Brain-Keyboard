### Functional Thinking
A framework for the interfacing structure of the fixed sequence of something that functions, both in concept and in practice.

- **Layer 1** - Name and Define **Functions**
1. A uni-gram captures a screenshot and/or a recording of any word, symbol, video, audio of a concept on its own or by a single frame. ^6br3d

2. N-grams captures a specific, coherent order of steps in a sequence. ^a5hxg

- **Layer 2** - Replacing and Linking **Functions** in any Problem 

1. Within a uni-gram and/or n-grams, capture any descriptors:
	Search up the definition of anything.
	Look inside predicates for the names of anything's definition and then its dynamic verbs.
	Define those dynamic verbs with the names together.
	Use antonyms and synonyms on the dynamic verbs then define those with the names together.  ^hg-gy

### Predicates
- Any capturing of any words, predicates, symbols, videos, audio and images in a specific, coherent order of steps (sequence) in any counting you want/find: 2, 3, 4, âˆž.... ^hdsb1

- A predicate is any descriptor of many sets of verbs/nouns that ends in -s, -es, -ing, -ed or irregularly that are linked to symbols, videos, and images. ^jc4og
